# LinkedList
This is the Linked List data structure . 
A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science used to organize and manage collections of elements, known as nodes. Unlike arrays, linked lists are dynamic and can easily grow or shrink in size, making them highly flexible for various applications. Here's an in-depth overview of linked lists:

Basic Structure
A linked list consists of a sequence of nodes where each node contains two main components:

Data: The value or information stored in the node.
Pointer (Reference): A link to the next node in the sequence.
